# Mert Yalçın
## Trainee Java-Angular Developer

After graduating from food engineering, I worked in the sector for about 1 year, then I quit my job and completed my military service. I always had a predisposition towards software and I aimed to create a career in this field. In general, I have completed several training and projects on Java, Spring, and Angular, but I also have the ability to understand other languages. As someone who comes from outside the sector, I believe that I will bring a different perspective to my colleagues and projects
